# Trivia-App
What has been done ?
When you will open application you will see splash screen and than you will come to home screen. On home screen i'm fetching data from the API mentioned in the document. After getting data i'm populating questions on home screen. For now i'm getting only 10 questions but you can pass param to get any number of questions. Questions contains multiple and boolean types. User will answer those question. Time restriction of 5 minutes added, user has to complete answers within 5 minutes. After 5 minutes or on pressing submit button user will be redirected to Scores screen where you will be able to find result of your Quiz.

What Third Lib is used ?
For API calling i'm using Retrofit. For managing sizing for different dimensions i'm using SDP library.

Any Bugs ? 
No Bugs so far.

Any Improvements ? 
App UI could be made better and interective but unfortunately i had very busy schedule that's why could not focus on UI. I'm showing all questions in the Recyclerview but these can also be shown one by one with next button to go to the next button.
